         * This conflates multiple requirements the API user promises to abide if
         * this option is enabled:
         *
         *  - The API user's render thread, which is calling the mpv_render_*()
         *    functions, never waits for the core. Otherwise deadlocks can happen.
         *    See "Threading" section.
         *  - The callback set with mpv_render_context_set_update_callback() can now
         *    be called even if there is no new frame. The API user should call the
         *    mpv_render_context_update() function, and interpret the return value
         *    for whether a new frame should be rendered.
         *  - Correct functionality is impossible if the update callback is not set,
         *    or not set soon enough after mpv_render_context_create() (the core can
         *    block while waiting for you to call mpv_render_context_update(), and
         *    if the update callback is not correctly set, it will deadlock, or
         *    block for too long).
         *
         * In general, setting this option will enable the following features (and
         * possibly more):
         *
         *  - "Direct rendering", which means the player decodes directly to a
         *    texture, which saves a copy per video frame ("vd-lavc-dr" option
         *    needs to be enabled, and the rendering backend as well as the
         *    underlying GPU API/driver needs to have support for it).
         *  - Rendering screenshots with the GPU API if supported by the backend
         *    (instead of using a suboptimal software fallback via libswscale).
         *
         * Warning: do not just add this without reading the "Threading" section
         *          above, and then wondering that deadlocks happen. The
         *          requirements are tricky. But also note that even if advanced
         *          control is disabled, not adhering to the rules will lead to
         *          playback problems. Enabling advanced controls simply makes
         *          violating these rules fatal.
